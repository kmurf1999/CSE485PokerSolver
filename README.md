# CSE 485 Poker Solver

This repository will be used for the CSE485 capstone project.

## Project Description

Our goal for this project is to create an application that will use reinforcement learning and self-play to create an un-exploitable or unbeatable strategy for Heads up no limit Texas Holdem'.  The program will learn to play poker by updating its strategy using an algorithm known as counterfactual regret
